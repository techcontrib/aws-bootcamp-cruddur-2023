## Iron Triangle & Agile Triangle - scratching the surface

Iron Triangle is a decision-making philosophy however "traditional" and hence world is shifting towards Agile Triangle where, iron triangle emphasizes cost, scope, and schedule, the agile triangle takes a broader focus on quality (intrinsic quality), value (extrinsic quality), and constraints (cost, scope, and schedule).   In agile triangle methodology, constraints are still a factor in measuring the success of a project, they are not the defining goal.

Traditional iron triangle illustrate as :point_down:

And agile triangle looks like this :point_down:

## Architecting the architecture - quick overview

** Pro-tip: Don't afraid of asking "dump questions" as everyone from different background have different conceptions so be the "dummy in the corner guy" and have a gut asking dump questions. **

It is always seen in a practice that people prefer or end up using a combination of various architecture frameworks __(TOGAF, Zachman Framework, Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DODAF), Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF)__ during the design phase.
